        "ingredients": ["6 fresh eggs cold", "1 tbsp sour cream - optional", "kosher or sea salt, black pepper", "2 tbsp finely chopped chives"],
        "steps": "Crack 6 eggs into a deep saucepan or nonstick skillet (cast-iron is fine). Add 1 tablespoon butter. Turn heat on stove to medium-high heat. Start stirring the eggs with a rubber spatula (not a whisk). In about a minute, while stirring continuously, the eggs will start forming curls. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as you go. Remove pan from heat for 10 seconds. Keep stirring. Place pan back on heat for 30 seconds. Keep stirring. Repeat, off heat 10 seconds, on heat 30 seconds, until eggs are almost cooked."
